# **Playing Card Detection with OpenCV**

Learning how to use open computer vision by detecting playing cards on a table with a variety of algorithms...

#### raw

#### gray and blur

#### canny edge detection
<img src='/imgs/edged.png'>

#### cards detected
<img src='/imgs/cards_detected.png'>

#### loop through and calculate the difference in a card and and every card in the deck
<img src='/imgs/diff.png'>

#### select the minimum difference
<img src='/imgs/diff_match.png'>

#### labeled

#### next steps...

how do you recognize cards that are not all the same and perfectly spread out???
